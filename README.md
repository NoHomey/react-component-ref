`ComponentRef` is a small helper `class` which should help you stay as much DRY as possible and encourage you to add `ref`s to your react `Components` when it's necessary (when you need it or a third party library needs access to native element). (see [Refs to Components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/more-about-refs.html) if you haven't already)
